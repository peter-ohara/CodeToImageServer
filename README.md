Backend Server for Code2Image Bot on Facebook

Code2Image is a messenger bot which highlights code sent to it and outputs it as a picture.

To use, you message the bot on messenger, enclosing your code between the three backticks (```), like so:

```
  print("Hello world")
  
```

And the bot will send back your code as an image, highlighted for easy reading and debugging.
